  title={Too hot to touch: the problem of high-level nuclear waste},
  author={Alley, William M and Alley, Rosemarie},
  year={2012},
  publisher={Cambridge University Press},
  annote={A very intriguing and accessible read on the history and more current situation of high-level
          nuclear waste. It is very useful for contextualizing the nuclear waste problem (costs, politics,
          proliferations etc.). It also points
          to other good references.}
